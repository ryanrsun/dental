St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE), and Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS).

The files are still under construction as only preliminary work has been performed to this point. Check back for 
regular updates.

UKB genetics data pre-processing was performed following many of the ideas from https://github.com/shiandy/ukbb-qc.
Our full Snakemake file will be available once results become more final.

UKB phenome cleaning was performed following many of the ideas from https://github.com/umich-cphds/createUKBphenome.
Our full Snakemake file will be available once results become more final.
